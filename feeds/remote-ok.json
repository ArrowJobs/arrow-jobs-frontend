This revolution is being fuelled by decentralized finance (or DeFi for short), which is enabling an assortment of pioneering developers and entrepreneurs to re-invent almost every financial product that is currently traded and invested in traditional markets, without requiring central authorities or siloed infrastructure. DeFi has captured a great deal of attention and investment in the crypto-aware niche, growing assets under management from $1 billion to $40 billion in less than a year. Impressive as its growth has been, its current market size isn't even a rounding error on the over $111 trillion held in traditional finance.

We are creating the largest public database of kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health info over the next 24 months.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone who has ever searched for information about their own strange health symptoms knows how bad the Internet is for answering these questions.

Because of our focus on data, our VP of Engineering should have strong backend expertise with fullstack flexibility. You should be comfortable with SQL and NoSQL database applications, caching &amp; scalability. You should also be able to interact with modern Javascript libraries and tooling, and you should be thoughtful about UX.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In general, we are programming language and front-end framework agnostic. We want to use the best tools for our growing product and team. We expect candidates to employ sound engineering and testing practices. Finally, we are sure you will have strong views about engineering team hiring, process, and management.\u00c2\u00a0</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Team</h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Alex Leeds</strong> previously led data science and business strategy teams at Squarespace.
